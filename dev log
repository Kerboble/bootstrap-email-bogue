up youtube tutorials on the subject and read up on their site.

11:30am - 4:00pm I attempted to make a basic version of what I wanted my email template to
look like. I had issues figuring out how the columns worked as I couldn't manage to have any
content show up alongside my first column. Went back and looked up more tutorials.

10am -12pm Sketched out a basic outline of what I want my layout to look like at a viewport of
xl, m, and small.

12pm-5pm I felt like my knowledge in css and html was lacking so I searched on youtube to fill
in the gaps or things that I have forgotten about. Made a mock of my first email template but I
am having troubles with adding a text-area with a button inside of it for the reply section of the
template.

10am - 6pm Went back to relearn more about html, css and bootstrap.

6pm - 8:30 Attended the head start session with Alexander to get feedback on my email
template. Decided I wanted to start over that night to make the design better and to apply what
Alex taught me.

10am -7pm Worked on my whole project to the point where I felt like I did a satisfactory job. I
finally understand how responsive design works and how you need to apply css properties
appropriately to make the elements selected responsive.

11am - Working on the little touch ups. Made it so text isn't spilling out of their containers when
resizing the viewport.Made my icons more responsive by giving them vh instead of pixels -
found out the issues to most of my problems were from hard setting properties to pixels in a
responsive environment. - I think I am done and happy with my project.

Was told that my third viewport size was not meaningful enough so I changed how the nav bar
is displayed when the VP is greater than 992px.
